## 👋 Hi, I’m **Anudeepsri Bathina**

I design, build, and scale **data-intensive and Generative AI systems** end to end — from raw ingestion and modeling to production-grade deployment on cloud platforms.

My work sits at the intersection of **Data Science, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Cloud Architecture**, with a strong bias toward systems that are explainable, secure, and usable in real enterprise environments.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

* **Generative AI & LLM Systems**
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic workflows, prompt engineering, evaluation, and governance for real-world use cases.

* **Applied Data Science & ML**
  Predictive modeling, NLP, semantic search, and analytics pipelines built on large-scale structured and unstructured data.

* **Cloud-Native Engineering**
  Designing and deploying production systems on **Azure and AWS**, with an emphasis on reliability, scalability, and cost awareness.

* **End-to-End Ownership**
  From problem framing and architecture to implementation, deployment, monitoring, and stakeholder communication.

---

## 💼 Experience Snapshot

* **10+ years** of hands-on experience delivering data, ML, and AI solutions across enterprise and product environments
* **Led teams of up to 11 engineers**, while also thriving in high-ownership, independent product roles
* Built and deployed **production GenAI systems** using Python, FastAPI, vector search, cloud AI services, and modern MLOps practices
* Strong background in **Azure AI, Azure Data Services, AWS ML services**, and cloud-native architectures

---

## 🎓 Teaching, Mentoring & Thought Leadership

* **3+ years** mentoring working professionals on applied AI and real-world case studies
* **25+ guest lectures and workshops** delivered across universities, global platforms, and professional programs
* Regularly help engineers bridge the gap between **theory and production-ready AI systems**
